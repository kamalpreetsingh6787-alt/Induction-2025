#### Day 3 (2 August 2025)
   *From 9 to 12 pm*
The morning began with a expert lecture given by a very kind and famous personality named Dr. Jaswinder Singh . He is honored with national and international allocades including the **PRIDE OF ASIA** award and recorded in the **ASEAN WORLD RECORD** and the **INTERNATIONAL BOOK OF RECORDS** for is contributions.
He frequently demonstrates exprimets wearing the knowledge jacket himself, making science more engaging.
He even told that , everything in our surroundings would be impossible without math.
Dr. Jaswinder Singh is a very intellectual person whose wisdom extends far beyond academic boundaries. Deeply rooted in the teachings of gurbani. He often draws strength and inspiration from **SHRI GURU GRANTH SAHIB JI**. He teached us many things about gurbani while giving the lecture . But the one thing which i deeply remember is that which he told **God Is One**.At last he honored in the auditorium.
   *From 12 to 2pm*
   Dr. Priyanshi Darshni Madam gave an lecture on **UNIVERSAL HUMAN VALUES** in auditorium.The UHV session was truly eye-opening. Madam began the class by asking us a very simple yet powerful question — “What is your basic aspiration in life?” This led to a meaningful discussion that made me reflect deeply on what I really want beyond just academic success.

She explained the difference between becoming something, getting something, and ultimately being — and helped us realise that our basic aspiration is not just to become an engineer or earn money, but to be happy and prosperous — in continuity. That word “continuity” struck me. It means not temporary happiness, but a consistent state of well-being.

Madam gave relatable examples from daily life — like doing an internship to get a job or working hard to make our families proud — and showed us how all these efforts are actually aimed at fulfilling our basic aspiration. We also discussed how multiple paths can lead to happiness, and if one path gets blocked, we can always choose another instead of giving up.

She even asked us to list our aspirations and concerns in our notebook. Some of mine were: doing well in college, being respected, making my parents happy. But I also noted down my concerns: self-doubt, peer pressure, and overthinking.

The most touching part was when madam related this journey to inner peace — something that aligns so well with the teachings of Gurbani. The values of contentment, clarity, and compassion that Gurbani talks about were reflected in this session too. It reminded me of the line: “Man jeetai jag jeet” — if you win over your mind, you win the world.

Overall, the session helped me understand that before chasing degrees or careers, I must understand my deeper goals. I’m grateful for madam’s guidance — her clarity and kindness made the session feel not like a lecture, but like a conversation with purpose.
